## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using personal workout data to better understand:

1. How heart rate correlates with calories burn?
2. Which type of workout is more effective, weights, bands, or body weight?
3. Does full-body workout burn more calories compared with body part focused workout?

The full set of heart rate image related to this project has personal data, so only two examples are available here.

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is one notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions.  The notebook is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions in project motivation.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

The data folder contains main data file home_workout.xlsx and two png images for examples of heart rate profile during workouts.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/p/5d45e7b2718a/edit).

Must give credit to Barry's Bootcamp family for the fitness journey. Big thanks to so many instructors for the friendship and support. For anyone interested to analyze your workout data, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
