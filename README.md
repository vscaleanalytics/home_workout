## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using personal workout data to better understand:

1. How heart rate correlates to calories burn?
2. Which type of workout is more effective among wights, bands and body weight?
3. Does full body workout burn more calories compared with regional focused workout?

The full set of data file related to this project has personal data, so it is not publicly available here.  However, you can see pieces of the data and whole analysis here.  

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is one notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions.  The notebook is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions in project motivation.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/p/5d45e7b2718a/edit).
